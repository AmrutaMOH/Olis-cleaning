To sync your changes with the upstream (i.e. the main repository - hdsb-on/olis-cleaning) through the command line, just simply type the command ``` .\sync.ps1 ``` in your terminal.
This will fetch and merge changes from upstream, so that your project will remain up-to date with all the changes committed by other members to the repository.
